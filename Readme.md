# Procedural World Generation

This is a generator for procedural world heightmaps.
The code is written in C# and based on [GeoMechanic](http://upvoid.com), a
discontinued sandbox game by Upvoid.

This is a work in progress. At the current state, only a basic png file showing a world map is generated.
